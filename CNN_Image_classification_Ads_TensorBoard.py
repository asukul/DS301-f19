# This tutorial shows how to classify cats or dogs from images. It builds an image classifier using a `tf.keras.Sequential` model and load data using `tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator`. You will get some practical experience and develop intuition for the following concepts:
# 
# * Building _data input pipelines_ using the `tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class to efficiently work with data on disk to use with the model.
# * _Overfitting_ —How to identify and prevent it.
# * _Data augmentation_ and _dropout_ —Key techniques to fight overfitting in computer vision tasks to incorporate into the data pipeline and image classifier model.
# 
# This tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:
# 
# 1. Examine and understand data
# 2. Build an input pipeline
# 3. Build the model
# 4. Train the model
# 5. Test the model
# 6. Improve the model and repeat the process

# ## Import packages

# Let's start by importing the required packages. The `os` package is used to read files and directory structure, NumPy is used to convert python list to numpy array and to perform required matrix operations and `matplotlib.pyplot` to plot the graph and display images in the training and validation data.

# For convenience, set up variables to use while pre-processing the dataset and training the network.

# epochs = 30
# epochs = 20

IMG_HEIGHT = 150
IMG_WIDTH = 150
#IMG_HEIGHT = 48
#IMG_WIDTH = 48


# ## Data preparation

# Format the images into appropriately pre-processed floating point tensors before feeding to the network:
# 
# 1. Read images from the disk.
# 2. Decode contents of these images and convert it into proper grid format as per their RGB content.
# 3. Convert them into floating point tensors.
# 4. Rescale the tensors from values between 0 and 255 to values between 0 and 1, as neural networks prefer to deal with small input values.
# 
# Fortunately, all these tasks can be done with the `ImageDataGenerator` class provided by `tf.keras`. It can read images from disk and preprocess them into proper tensors. It will also set up generators that convert these images into batches of tensors—helpful when training the network.

# In[15]:


# Generator for our training data
train_image_generator = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
# Generator for our validation data
validation_image_generator = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)


# After defining the generators for training and validation images, the `flow_from_directory` method load images from the disk, applies rescaling, and resizes the images into the required dimensions.

# ## Create the model

# The model consists of three convolution blocks with a max pool layer in each of them. There's a fully connected layer with 512 units on top of it that is activated by a `relu` activation function. The model outputs class probabilities based on binary classification by the `sigmoid` activation function.

# In[21]:

    Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH ,3)),

# As you can see from the plots, training accuracy and validation accuracy are off by large margin and the model has achieved only around **70%** accuracy on the validation set.
# 
# Let's look at what went wrong and try to increase overall performance of the model.

# ## Overfitting

# In the plots above, the training accuracy is increasing linearly over time, whereas validation accuracy stalls around 70% in the training process. Also, the difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is noticeable—a sign of *overfitting*.
# 
# When there are a small number of training examples, the model sometimes learns from noises or unwanted details from training examples—to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new examples. This phenomenon is known as overfitting. It means that the model will have a difficult time generalizing on a new dataset.
# 
# There are multiple ways to fight overfitting in the training process. In this tutorial, you'll use *data augmentation* and add *dropout* to our model.

# ## Data augmentation

# Overfitting generally occurs when there are a small number of training examples. One way to fix this problem is to augment the dataset so that it has a sufficient number of training examples. Data augmentation takes the approach of generating more training data from existing training samples by augmenting the samples using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. The goal is the model will never see the exact same picture twice during training. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.
# 
# Implement this in `tf.keras` using the `ImageDataGenerator` class. Pass  different transformations to the dataset and it will take care of applying it during the training process.

# ### Augment and visualize data

# Begin by applying random horizontal flip augmentation to the dataset and see how individual images look like after the transformation.

# ### Apply horizontal flip

# Pass `horizontal_flip` as an argument to the `ImageDataGenerator` class and set it to `True` to apply this augmentation.

# In[22]:


image_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, horizontal_flip=True)


# In[23]:


train_data_gen = image_gen.flow_from_directory(batch_size=batch_size,
                                               directory=train_dir,
                                               shuffle=True,
                                               target_size=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH))


# Take one sample image from the training examples and repeat it five times so that the augmentation is applied to the same image five times.

augmented_images = [train_data_gen[0][0][0] for i in range(5)]


# In[25]:


# Re-use the same custom plotting function defined and used
# above to visualize the training images
plotImages(augmented_images)


# ### Randomly rotate the image

# Let's take a look at a different augmentation called rotation and apply 45 degrees of rotation randomly to the training examples.

# In[26]:


image_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, rotation_range=45)


# In[27]:


train_data_gen = image_gen.flow_from_directory(batch_size=batch_size,

# In[28]:


plotImages(augmented_images)


# ### Apply zoom augmentation

# Apply a zoom augmentation to the dataset to zoom images up to 50% randomly.

# In[29]:


# zoom_range from 0 - 1 where 1 = 100%.
image_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, zoom_range=0.5) #

train_data_gen = image_gen.flow_from_directory(batch_size=batch_size,

augmented_images = [train_data_gen[0][0][0] for i in range(5)]


# In[31]:


plotImages(augmented_images)


# ### Put it all together

# Apply all the previous augmentations. Here, you applied rescale, 45 degree rotation, width shift, height shift, horizontal flip and zoom augmentation to the training images.

# In[32]:


image_gen_train = ImageDataGenerator(
                    rescale=1./255,

                                                     shuffle=True,
                                                     target_size=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH),
                                                     class_mode='binary')


# Visualize how a single image would look five different times when passing these augmentations randomly to the dataset.

# In[34]:


augmented_images = [train_data_gen[0][0][0] for i in range(5)]
plotImages(augmented_images)


# ### Create validation data generator

# Generally, only apply data augmentation to the training examples. In this case, only rescale the validation images and convert them into batches using `ImageDataGenerator`.

# In[35]:


image_gen_val = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)


# In[36]:


val_data_gen = image_gen_val.flow_from_directory(batch_size=batch_size,
                                                 # directory=validation_dir,
                                                 directory=test_dir,
                                                 target_size=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH),
                                                 class_mode='binary')


# ## Dropout

# Another technique to reduce overfitting is to introduce *dropout* to the network. It is a form of *regularization* that forces the weights in the network to take only small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more regular and the network can reduce overfitting on small training examples. Dropout is one of the regularization technique used in this tutorial
# 
# When you apply dropout to a layer it randomly drops out (set to zero) number of output units from the applied layer during the training process. Dropout takes a fractional number as its input value, in the form such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, etc. This means dropping out 10%, 20% or 40% of the output units randomly from the applied layer.
# 
# When appling 0.1 dropout to a certain layer, it randomly kills 10% of the output units in each training epoch.
# 
# Create a network architecture with this new dropout feature and apply it to different convolutions and fully-connected layers.

# ## Creating a new network with Dropouts

# Here, you apply dropout to first and last max pool layers. Applying dropout will randomly set 20% of the neurons to zero during each training epoch. This helps to avoid overfitting on the training dataset.

# In[37]:


model_new = Sequential([
    Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same', activation='relu', 
           input_shape=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH ,3)),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Conv2D(32, 3, padding='same', activation='relu'),
